        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is prejudice?</h2>
          <p>A hostile or negative attitude toward people in a distinguishable group, based solely on their membership in that group</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Three Components of prejudice</h2>
          <p><b class="orange">1.</b> Stereotypes: The Cognitive Component</p>
          <p><b class="orange">2.</b> Emotions: The Affective Component</p>
          <p><b class="orange">3.</b> Discrimination: The Behavioral Component</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Stereotypes: The Cognitive Component</h2>
          <p>A generalization about a group of people, in which certain traits are assigned to virtually all members of the group, regardless of actual variation among the members</p>
          <p>e.g. (We all have stereotypes: Jewish people are very rich/African people are very poor)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why do we have stereotypes?</h2>
          <p><b class="orange">1.</b> Media</p>
          <p><b class="orange">2.</b> Illusory Correlation</p>
          <p>The tendency to see relationships, or correlations, between events that are actually unrelated</p>
          <p>e.g. (Western people tend to believe that the black dog would bring bad luck)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What's more?</h2>
          <p>Stereotypes can set up expectations to groups which have been misunderstood</p>
          <p>e.g. (Asain children were believed to have better porformance in academic area, but not all people are good at it)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What's more?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are differences between individuals.</li>
                <p> (both man and woman can be aggressive or gentle)</p>
              <li>Hostile sexists</li>
                <p> Women are inferior to men because they are inherently less intelligent, less competent, less brave, less capable of math and science, and so on.</p>
              <li>Benevolent sexists</li>
                <p> Women are kinder than men, more empathic, more nurturing, and so on.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Emotions: The Affective Component</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>With emotion, we wouldn't be logic anymore</li>
            <li>We only see information that confirms how right we are about "those people"</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>That can lead to implicit prejudice</p>
          <p>(People pretend to be consistent with the PC environment, but keep negative feelings under the surface)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Discrimination: The Behavioral Component</h2>
          <p>It is unjustified negative or harmful action toward a member of a group solely because of his or her membership in that group</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microaggressions</li>
            <p>Small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless</p>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Modern Racism and Other Implicit Prejudices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Laws determine that discrimination is illegal</li>
            <li>People become more careful to maintaining their prejudiced feelings</li>
            <li>That is called modern racism</li>
            <p>	Outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes</p>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>How do we measure implicit prejudice?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Bogus pipeline</li>
            <p>Researchers convinced participants that the polygraph is effective, but it is actually fake.</p>
            <p>e.g. (Do you remember the TV program Jimmy Show)<p>
            <li>Implicit Association Test (IAT)</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Computer based research</li>
              <li>The study participant can't "fool" the machine</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Under what situation that people can activate their implicit prejudices?</h2>
          <p>When people are stressed, angry, have suffered a blow to their self-esteem, or otherwise are not in full control of their conscious intentions.</p>
          <p>They often behave with greater aggression or hostility toward a stereotyped target than toward members of their own group.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Under what situation that people can activate their implicit prejudices?</h2>
          <p>Two-Step Model of the Cognitive</P>
          <ul>
            <li>A stereotype is automatically activated when a person encounters a member of a minority group, but the stereotype can be ignored or refuted through conscious processing</li>
            <li>However, when the person is busy, overwhelmed, distracted, or not paying much attention, the person may not be able to initiate that controlled level of processing.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Effects of Prejudice on the Victim</h2>
          <p>Self-Fulfilling prophecies</p>
          <p>	The case wherein people have an expectation about what another person is like, which influences how they act toward that person, which causes that person to behave consistently with people's original expectations, making the expectations come true.</p>
          <p>e.g. (If you believe that Amy is stupid, you probably will not ask her interesting questions, and you will not listen intently while she is talking)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <p>The apprehension experienced by members of a group that their behavior might confirm a cultural stereotype</p>
          <p>e.g. (The victim often internalizes these societal expectations and comes to believe them: "I guess I must be stupid if everybody thinks so.")</p>

          <h2>What Causes Prejudice?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>prejudice may originally have served as a survival mechanism inducing people to favor their own families and tribes.</li>
