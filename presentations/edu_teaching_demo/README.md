# fs102Spring2017-presentation02-liux2

This repository is created for me to have a template for my presentation. you can view the slide at: http://cdn.rawgit.com/liux2/fs102Spring2017-presentation02-liux2/master/Internet_Piracy_2017.html

If you want to read the original article that I wrote, here is the [portal](https://liux2.github.io/2017-03-29-Portrait-of-Piracy/).

## Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/liux2/fs102Spring2017-presentation01-liux2.git
```

Please note that the presentation uses local fonts so that it can be displayed at a conference on a laptop that either
may not have access to the Internet or may only have unreliable Internet access. Some browsers may disallow the loading
of local fonts due to security reasons. However, it should be possible for you to view the presentation correctly when
using Chrome or Chromium on the Ubuntu operating system &mdash; this is my primary development environment and the one
that I used to give the presentation. However, I anticipate that the presentation slides should display correctly on a
wide variety of operating systems and browsers.

I have found that some versions of Chrome and Chromium do not quickly load the full-screen images that I use as
backgrounds. If you notice this problem as well, then I would encourage you to "serve" the presentation with a local Web
server, such as the Ruby-based one available at [jlong/serve](https://github.com/jlong/serve). If you adopt this
approach, then you should type the following command:

```shell
serve 4100
```

Now, you can navigate to the Web site `http://localhost:4100/seke2015_panel.html` and view the presentation.  Ultimately,
if you are unable to get the presentation to display correctly in your own web browser, then please open a new issue and
I will attempt to resolve your concerns.
