My name is Xingbang Liu.

### My History

The first time I owned a “computer” was when I was in junior high school. It was not a computer as people usually understand it, it was a smartphone. I have tried many systems and ROMs, such as Windows mobile, Windows phone 7, Android MIUI, Android HTC Sense, and Android CyanogenMod on my HTC HD2 smartphone. I also tried different plugins, such as f.lux, ZanTi after I rooted the smartphone. Also, during my high school time, I was addicted to find a way to jump over the National Firewall in China, and I found the ShadowSocks project on GitHub. Following the introduction, I learned how to build ShadowSocks in an Ubuntu VPS server. Since I was always interested in computers, I decided to major in computer science in college.

### Computer Science Education Lift

My strongest programming language is Java. I have been using it since my first introductory course in computer science where it was introduced. I have completed many labs and projects since then to enhance my object-oriented programming and problem solving skills. For example, in my first computer science introductory course I experimented with string manipulation, loops, switch, and if/if else statements. For my final project in that course I developed a library system that allowed administrators to search the book by subject, author, title, series number. It also checks the status of the book and whether there is a fine for the book being overdue. In this group project, I brainstormed the functions of the library system with my group members, and then built the structure of the system, which includes four classes. During the next level of computer science courses, I completed labs related to data structures and the analytical and experimental evaluation of algorithm performance. In my final project, my group made a Texas Hold’em Poker Game by using Stack and ArrayList. In this group work, Xingbang Liu page 3 we brainstormed the structure of the whole game, and then I developed the main piece of the game in Java.

### Perspectives

I am an International student from China. I have been traveling a lot by myself since I was ten years old. I really appreciate my parents allowing me to travel by myself as traveling made me have experiences handling unfamiliar situations and exploring new areas. Now I am studying abroad, which makes me have an open view on different cultures and I have an opportunity to communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds. Based on this experience, I am also adaptable to change. In addition, I have experience with different services and I am familiar with user’s preferences. For example, I have used Google Now, Cortana, and Siri since high school. Since my interests lie in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), I tried to explore what AI systems could understand and what they could not understand. In this way, I can understand the logic behind the program. For example, Xiaobing, which is the Chinese version of Zo, could not understand user’s questions that did not have a strong logic behind them. When that happened, Xiaobing could not ask people follow up questions for more information.

### Community Life

I have participated in clubs, such as soccer club, International Club, and International Student Adversary Board. In soccer club, I socialize and play soccer with club members or students from other colleges. International Club is mainly used by International Xingbang Liu page 4 students to communicate and organize activities to present different cultures. As for International Adversary Board, our job is to coordinate between International education office and International students, so that the office can help International students with their life in America, their studies, and their final careers. We also organize activities, such as a career workshop and a driver’s license workshop, for the Allegheny College community.
