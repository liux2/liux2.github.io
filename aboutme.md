### My History

__TL;DR A short introduction about how I got addicted to software__

My name is Xingbang, but you can call me Sheldon. It is easier for you to remember and pronounce. This article is mainly an introduction about me and how I become interested in software.

I'm from China. When I was a little kid, I didn't expect myself to have any connection to computers and software. The reason is, my father thought I could get addicted to computer games and he also thought I could have some bad influence from the internet, such as become violent and impolite. So, I didn't have a chance to get to know computers. However, everything has changed since junior high school.

I received my first electronic gift when I was in junior high school. It was an HTC HD2 smart phone. From this gift, I had a basic impression of different systems. Due to the strong capability of this smart phone, I have installed windows mobile, android and windows phone in this smart phone. From this experience, I fell in love with computers. After gaining access to the internet and electronic devices, I learned more and more information about software, computers, and systems. With the help of my laptop, I have practiced a lot.

Now, since our lives are closely connected to computer, we use various software to help us in our daily lives. When I started to learn how to make html websites, I have used Adobe Dreamweaver. If I want to access the data and documents, I would use Microsoft Office. I use photoshop to create memes. I use CPU-Z/GPU-Z to figure out my computer configuration. I use Matlab to create mathematical models. I have used a lot of software that has been helpful to me.

This is me, a person who is closely connected to software now. This is also my motivation to devote my studies to the field of computer science.
