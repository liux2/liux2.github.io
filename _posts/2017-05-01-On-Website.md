**TL;DR The evaluation of using GitHub and Markdown to publish articles**

Lots of people like to write and publish articles on mobile-ready websites by using Markdown and GitHub. It is different than Docs and accessing business servers.  

For lots of people, including me myself, the most common applications that we use to edit articles are Microsoft Word and Google Docs. These applications have their advantages, such as, what we see is what we would finally have, and they are more popular in usual office conditions. Bosses like to comment on word docs. However, these applications have shortcomings. For example, we have to spend lots of time to edit. That would be inconvenient for coders, blog writers, and website editors. In this case, Markdown would be the best choice for them. People can edit the article by using several codes.

There are not much differences between using GitHub to publish articles and using business servers to publish articles. However, GitHub is a community, so that people who have the same interests would help others to improve others website. Finally, it is free.

It is usersâ€™ choice to decide which kind of approach to use. As long as users know the features between each file, they can make the best choice.
