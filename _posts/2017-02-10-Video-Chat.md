Some people say that people are more and more “isolated” nowadays. Maybe the reason is we tend to work and study far away from home, but more people believe that technology is the actual reason to blame. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and the social apps installed, people are more and more addicted to a virtual society. That maybe right, but I would say technology, for example, video chat, actually make us more connected than ever before.
