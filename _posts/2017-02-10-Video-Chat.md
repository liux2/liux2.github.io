**TL;DR Even though we are living far away from each other, we are still connected by video chat**

Some people say that individuals are more and more “isolated” nowadays. Maybe the reason is we tend to work and study far away from home &mdash; but more people believe that technology is the actual reason to blame. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and the social apps that are installed on them, people are more and more addicted to a virtual society. That maybe right, but I would say technology &mdash; for example, video chat &mdash; actually makes us more connected than ever before.

You might have the experiences that Skype your friends or your families at some case. However, for people who are “old” enough, do you still remember the time before 2000? We didn’t have such a popular technology to convenient us. Back to that ancient time, if people want to talk to their families from far away, the choices were telephone and emails. If managers want to have a meeting with others, they might have to travel across the country, or even ocean. That was very inconvenient for us. We had to pay a lot to get our telephones connected, it was much expensive if it was an international conversation. For managers, after a long-time travel, they would lose all the energies they had. I had the similar experience, too.

When I was a little kid, there were no video chat services. We didn’t even have low-speed Internet at that time because I was living in a small town in China, where we didn’t have a good infrastructure. The only thing we had was an extremely low-speed Internet connection and telephones. My house was far away from my grandparents’. Apparently, the telephone couldn’t fulfill my grandparents’ wish to see me in person. So we had to travel for a long time each time we wanted to go visit my grandparents. That was a problem until the popularize and commercialize of high-speed Internet and video chat. The usual apps for video call could be Skype, WeChat (A Tencent application that is wildly used by Chinese people), or 3G/4G video chat. Now, I can simply tap the video call bottom in the application to communicate with my grandparents “face-to-face”.

With the help of video chat, we can not only achieve “face-to-face” video chat with families but also a lot of other functions. For example, we can do an interview through video chat. If interviewer and interviewee live far away from each other, it would be very inconvenient for the interviewee to travel for a long time. That would cost a lot of money and time, which is inefficient. A lot of my friends in China did that when they have to be interviewed by college admissions officers. Imagine that, if we don’t have video chat now, they would have to travel all the way to America to take the interview. I still remember when I was in high school, a friend of mine had a great teacher who lives far away from him. He was using video chat to take the course from his teacher. It is the same with remote surgery. Hospitals don’t have to spend a lot of money and time to invite famous doctors. The doctors can just use video chat to direct the surgery remotely.
