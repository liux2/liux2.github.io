**TL;DR How can we use technology to protect our works being plagiarized through technology**

Plagiarism, which is copying others idea or work and pretend it is your work according to [Cambridge Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/plagiarize?q=plagiarism), is always being a problem since a long time ago, it became serious since the technology is becoming more and more advanced. Some people say that technology is a great way to spread the information, and that makes it easier for people to copy and paste. There are also people think that technology can be helpful to archive people's work, so that the plagiarism can be easily checked online. What I am agreed with, is the first group of people, technology makes it easier for people to plagiarize. However, I also think that technology can be used to protect our works.

Nowadays, technologies have been developed significantly, especially in the field of Internet and computer devices. The improving of technologies brought significant improvements for sharing of information. If a person wants to share some information, he can simply put it in public internet space. Moreover, if that person wants to make a big news from that information, he can simply create an interesting title and use a right platform to share it. With such an advantage of sharing the information, other people could easily find ideas which he needed, even if the original author didn't publish it yet. The worst case would be the people who found the idea stole the idea and made others believe that this idea is his. In the United States of America, we have a "de facto copyright", which means the writer would have a copyright once he written the paper([Legal Beagle](http://legalbeagle.com/5135133-copyright-paper.html)). Additionally, there are a lot of paper website in the internet. All those factors makes it hard to track the status of an idea or a paper, that means if an author thinks his work has been copied, and he did not publish it in the internet, book, magazine, or register it in U.S. Copyright Office, he would find it hard to defend himself.  

* naysayers
Of course, many will probably disagree on the grounds that 
as I mentioned in the beginning.
* solutions(Paper website almost as same as Github, "special numbers" even didn't publish it yet)
