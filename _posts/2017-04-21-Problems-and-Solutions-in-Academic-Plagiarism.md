**TL;DR How can we use technology to protect our works being plagiarized through technology**

Plagiarism, which is copying others idea or work and pretend it is your own work according to [Cambridge Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/plagiarize?q=plagiarism), is always being a problem since a long time ago, it became serious since the technology is becoming more and more advanced. Some people say that technology is a great way to spread the information, and that makes it easier for people to copy and paste. There are also people think that technology can be helpful to archive people's work, so that the plagiarism can be easily checked online. What I am agreed with, is the first group of people, technology make it easier for people to plagiarize. However, I also think that technology can be used to protect our works.
