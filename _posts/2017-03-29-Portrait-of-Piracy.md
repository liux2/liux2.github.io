**TL;DR Let's hear some public opinion on Piracy**

In a world where people enjoy the convenience of Internet like today, products like music, software, books are all over the internet. However, while we enjoy these products, unlicensed products are eating up the market share of the original product due to various reasons. Here is a graphic statistics about the piracy status in 2015:

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5164/use-of-unlicensed-software/" title="Infographic: The Cost of Software Piracy | Statista"><img src="https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_5164_use_of_unlicensed_software_n.jpg" alt="Infographic: The Cost of Software Piracy | Statista" width="100%" height="auto" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a> You will find more statistics at <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista</a>

This graph showed that China has the biggest rate of piracy, but US has the biggest value of piracy products.

What about people's opinion on digital piracy ("the practice of illegally copying and selling digital music, video, computer software, etc." according to [Cambridge Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/digital-piracy))?

In order to get to know people's ideas on digital piracy, I designed a survey. Based on their income, I have interviewed two different people. The first person I have interviewed was Zhangzi Yang, a sophomore in Allegheny College. The second person I have interviewed was Tamara, who is a TA at Allegheny College for 2016-2017. This survey contains two parts. The first part asks them personal questions which can describe themselves. Here is part 1, and answers of my interviewees:

1.	Do you mind if I ask you about your salary?
* Zhangzi Yang: My income plus my family support would be 1500-2000 dollars per year.
* Tamara: My income was about 35 dollars per month on average, which is 420 dollars per year on average.
2.	Do you enjoy watching downloaded videos, listening to downloaded music or using downloaded software?
* Zhangzi Yang: Yes, I like listening to music and watching video online.
* Tamara: Yes, I am.
3.  Are you willing to pay for these online resources?
* Zhangzi Yang: Yes, and that depends on my personal interests. If I like it, I would buy it.
* Tamara: It depends on the price, for example, I would pay for Netflix because it was only 8 dollars per month. If the price is higher than that, I wouldn't pay for it.
4.	Have you ever heard of Internet piracy?
* Zhangzi Yang: Yes
* Tamara: Yes.

Before we move on to next section of questions, I will give my interviewee some extra information. The purpose was to give my interviewees a general idea about the income of singers. Here is the extra information:

According to the book [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online-2015-remix/), artists could earn about 12 dollars per song by selling CDs. They could earn about 8.50 dollars per album at Bandcamp, and that number didn’t include 15% of distributer cost. They could earn about 2.30 dollars per album at iTunes, and other coats were about 77%. In the same platform except that it was per song, artists could earn about 0.69 dollars, and that didn’t include 30% of other costs.

In next section, I asked them the following questions to get their reaction of these facts I told them, and see if their idea about digital piracy changed. Here is part two, and answers of my interviewees:

5.	After learning about a producer’s income, do you think the income is high or low?
* Zhangzi Yang: I think it depends on how popular the artist is. If the artist is very popular, he would earn a lot of money even with 0.6 dollars per song.
* Tamara: I would say most of them don't earn a lot.
6.	Based on the knowledge you had and the information I told you, what impression do you have now about piracy? Good or Bad?
* Zhangzi Yang: When I was a little kid, I thought it was really fantastic. I didn't have much pocket money at that time. I could use 0.43 dollars to purchase a Doraemon comic book. Now, I think it is better if I purchase the legal copy, because it is way of support the author.
* Tamara: It is bad for singers who are not famous because famous people would earn money anyways. I mean, piracy isn't that bad because people would usually download famous songs or movies.
7.	Imagine you are the copyright resources provider, what do you think of piracy?
* Zhangzi Yang: If I am the author, I would think it is bad, because I can't earn my money.
* Tamara: If I am the producer, I wouldn't like it, because it would hurt my interests. However, I would understand their difficulties.
8.	Can you think of some negative effects of piracy?
* Zhangzi Yang: The pirated edition could have bad quality most of the time, and I would feel bad for the producer.
* Tamara: The quality of the product would be bad if it is pirated edition. Also the producers who are not famous will lost money because of pirate.
9.	Can you think of some positive effects of piracy?
* Zhangzi Yang: The pirated edition is way cheaper than legal edition, most of the time it was free. If the legal edition is cheaper than the pirated edition, I would but it without hesitate. Also, pirate edition could be more customized, I could use add-in items.
* Tamara: I think we shouldn't pay much for literature products or any kinds of cultural products. So, I think pirated product makes education easier.
10.	If piracy were legal in certain circumstances, would you try it?
* Zhangzi Yang: Yes, I would try it.
* Tamara: Yes
11.	If you would, what would be your motivation?
* Zhangzi Yang: I can save money from this. In other cases, for example, if the video doesn't have any subtitles, I could use pirate edition to add subtitles. Also, if the video has restrictions in my area, I could use a pirated edition.
* Tamara: I can access more resources without paying, and I would gain more education without being richer.

Based on this survey, I have some findings. My interviewees have different income per year, Ziyang has more salary than Tamara, and Ziyang is more willing to pay for copyright products. However, both of them would try pirate if it is legal under some circumstances because pirate can save money, and pirated edition have worse quality. I agree with them. Even though high income makes copyright products affordable, it is always good to save some money. When I asked about their opinion about the income of music producers, they all agreed that pirate is bad for not famous producers. Particularly, Tamara pointed that high price could be the barrier between people and better education.
