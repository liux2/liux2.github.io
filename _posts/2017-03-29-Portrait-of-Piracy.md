**TL;DR Let's hear some public opinion on Piracy**

In a world that people enjoying the convince of Internet like today, product like music, software, books are all over the internet. However, while we are enjoying those products, unlicensed products are eating the market share of original product. That was due to various of reasons, but we won't talk about it now. Here we would mainly discuss people's opinion of digital piracy, which is "the practice of illegally copying and selling digital music, video, computer software, etc." according to [Cambridge Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/digital-piracy).

In order to get to know people's idea on digital piracy, I have designed a survey. This survey contains two parts. The first part would be about themselves. Here is part 1:

1.	Do you enjoy either watching videos, listening to music or using the software from online?
2.	Are you willing to pay for these online resources?
3.  Do you mind if I ask you about your income?
4.	Have you ever heard of Piracy?

Now, I will give my interviewee some extra information. The purpose of that information is to let my interviewees have a general idea on the income of singers. Here is the extra information:

According to the book [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online-2015-remix/), artists could earn about 12 dollars per song by selling CDs. They could earn about 8.50 dollars per album at Bandcamp, and that number didn’t include 15% of distributer cost. They could earn about 2.30 dollars per album at iTunes, and other coats were about 77%. In the same platform except that it was per song, artists could earn about 0.69 dollars, and that didn’t include 30% of other costs.

After that, I would ask them questions about their reaction of knowing the fact I told them, and their idea about digital piracy. Here is part two:

5.	After hearing the fact of producer’s income, do you think the income was high o low?
6.	Based on the knowledge you had and the information I told you, what impression do you have now on piracy? Good or Bad?
7.	If you are the copyright resources provider, what do you think of piracy?
8.	Can you think of some example that can be the bad side of piracy?
9.	Can you think of some example that can be the good side of piracy?
10.	If piracy is legal in some sense, would you try it?
11.	If so, what would be the motivation?

Based on their income, I have interviewed two different people.

The first person I have interviewed was Zhangzi Yang, a sophomore in Allegheny College. Here is a record of his respond:

1. My income plus my family support would be 1500-2000 dollars per year.
2. Yes, I like listening to music and watching video online.
3. Yes, and that depends on my personal interests. If I like it, I would buy it.
4. Yes
5. I think it depends on how popular the artist is. If the artist is very popular, he would earn a lot of money even with 0.6 dollars per song.
6. When I was a little kid, I thought it was really fantastic. I didn't have much pocket money at that time. I could use 0.43 dollars to purchase a Doraemon comic book. Now, I think it is better if I purchase the legal copy, because it is way of support the author.
7. If I am the author, I would think it is bad, because I can't earn my money.
8. The pirate edition could have bad quality most of the time, and I would feel guilty to producer.
9. The pirate edition is way cheaper than legal edition, most of the time it was free. If the legal edition is cheaper than pirate edition, I would but it without hesitate. Also, pirate edition could be more customized, I could add add-in items.
10. Yes, I would try it.
11. I can save money from that. In other cases, for example, if the video doesn't has any subtitle, I could use pirate edition to add a subtitle in it. Also, it the video has restrictions in my area, I could use a pirate edition.

The second person I have interviewed was Tamara, who is the TA in Allegheny College for 2016-2017. Here is a record of her answers:

1. My income was about 35 dollars per month in average, which is 420 dollars per month in average.
2. Yes, I am.
3. It depend on the price, for example, I would pay for Netflix, because it was only 8 dollars per month. If the price is higher than that, I wouldn't pay for it.
4. Yes.
5. I would say most of them don't earn a lot.
6. It is bad for singers who are not famous, because famous people would earn money anyways. I mean, piracy isn't that bad because people would usually download famous songs or movies.
7. If I am the producer, I wouldn't like it, because it would hurt my benefits.
