**TL;DR Even though The Google Empire has convents us a lot, but is it safe to keep all our personal information in Google?**

As everyone has noticed, Google is everywhere now. People use Google to receive news, search what they want to know, or to keep their agenda up-to-date. Google's product is really everywhere, he is like a huge empire trying to increase its boundaries. What Google trying to do is create a closed and concise environment where people can finish most of the daily routine by using that environment. Now you may think that this is really convenient which is a big truth. However, by using google, most of our personal information is up to their in Google's server. What if hackers break the door, or Google just left a back door to some Government or none government organization? That would be a huge problem to us.
