**TL;DR Even though The Google Empire has convents us a lot, but is it safe to keep all our personal information in Google?**

As everyone has noticed, Google is everywhere now. People use Google to receive news, search what they want to know, or to keep their agenda up-to-date. Google's product is really everywhere, he is like a huge empire trying to increase its boundaries. What Google trying to do is create a closed and concise environment where people can finish most of the daily routine by using that environment. Now you may think that this is really convenient which is a big truth. However, by using google, most of our personal information is up to their in Google's server. What if hackers break the door, or Google just left a back door to some Government or none government organization? That would be a huge problem to us.

As e-commerce and the virtual product being popular, people tend to link their credit card to online services. Until now, the most popular smartphone system is Android which is a Google company product. Compared to other smartphone systems, Android users are about 63.99%. As the picture shows:

Most of the people would connect their credit card to their Google Play so that they could purchase apps on their smartphone easily. However, there might be potential safety problems of linking your card to Google product. What if your card information could be compromised because it is on your computer, and what if Google’s services could be the helper of a hacker? One of the ways that hackers use to get your card information is by publishing malware. Sometimes, you might receive strange emails in your Gmail box which contain some virus or strange links. Once you opened the email or clicked the link, your card information would be compromised.

Now, lots of people are using Google+ service, Google Drive, Google Contact, etc. A lot of personal information, such as families phone numbers, families mail addresses, your personal meta-information, etc., are stored in corresponding servers. As our identification became more and more electronically, our personal information has faced more and more potential danger of been stolen. Once the theft got what they want, you or your friends would be in big trouble. The theft could overdraw your credibility to gain illegal benefits from you or your companies. A statistic from an Australian government website (Scamwatch) showed that in January 2017, the amount of lost money due to identity theft in Australia was 12,529 dollars. I have heard my friend been in that trouble. One day his mom asked about did he received money she transferred last week, but after my friend heard of that, he was totally lost. Of course, he didn’t ask for money, so the only explanation is that was a theft. His mom said that the theft was using that “same” email address and he knows some experiences that others couldn’t know. Finally, my friend was aware that the information was from his cloud drive. Now the most strange part is how could the theft gain the password or ways to access my friend’s cloud drive? The following picture showed how people got hacked:

From the picture, we can know that hackers could also use Email to open the door of your computer, which is the same as the first example. As Daily mail has reported in May 2016, a hacker, whose name is Alex Holden, stole 272.3 million Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Mail.ru account information including password, and he traded them in Russia. That information could be used in access their Email or other similar accounts. However, there might be a huge chance that the virus or malware would be hidden in some web pages. Despite some tricky websites, which could redirect the user to dangerous websites or install malware in user’s computer, where we need to find some information, even google.com has some “partially dangerous” which was said by Google himself. As theguardian reported, in Google’s “Safe Browsing” report, some pages could install malware on users’ computer, and some pages would redirect the website to another dangerous website. For example, websites, such as maeaflordapele.com, valeimaginar.blogspot.com, would send users to dangerous locations, such as 7b726aeb-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com, 40d0dfd9-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com. 

Issues and examples:
1. Linked credit card
2. Personal info could be used in scam
3. back door for Gov. (Snowdon)
