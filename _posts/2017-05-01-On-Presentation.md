**TL;DR The evaluation of using GitHub and reveal.js to prepare and deliver presentations**

Microsoft PowerPoint or Google slides are so common to use, but they have shortcomings. Have you ever have the situation that spends a lot of time to set up your slides when you suppose to done it as soon as you could. This is the biggest shortcoming that they have. These applications are not mobile enough; people have to transfer files between computers. The application that can fix this problem is reveal.js, which is an open source project on GitHub. So, it is free. Also, it is HTML format slide, and the host server is GitHub, so, people can open it everywhere as long as they have the URL. Since it is on GitHub, people can give advice and feedbacks in issue bar. That is great when people want to improve their works. Besides these advantages, the only disadvantage I can think of is: people could spend a lot of time to learn it since it is HTML file.
Different people have different demands, if you are looking for ways to prepare and deliver presentations with a mobile style, I strongly recommend reveal.js.
